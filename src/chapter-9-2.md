Coaching can also include providing guidance on how to improve performance and develop skills and knowledge.

Encouraging Self-Evaluation and Reflection

Encouraging self-evaluation and reflection promotes employee ownership of their performance outcomes.

This helps ensure that everyone understands the context and rationale for decisions.

Holding Oneself Accountable for Actions and Outcomes
